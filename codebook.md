# Interpreting the resulting datasets created by run_analysis.R

The function outputs two datasets to the users local workspace.  These are:
1. wearable.txt
2. subject_averages.txt

The first is a dataset with 10,299 rows and 88 colummns.  The rows are composed of observations for the following variables (in order)
1. subjectID - A number corresponding to 1 out of 30 people who subjected themselves to the wearables technology study
2. activity - A description of what the subject was doing when measurements were being sampled
Consult the "features_info.txt" file of the original dataset for descriptions of the following
